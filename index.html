    <h1>DATA ANALYSIS OF TWEETS ABOUT THE WORLD CUP.</h1>
    <h2>Question:</h2>
      <h2>Is the 2022 world cup positive or negative with the sentiment of the tweets of the world cup. </h2>
    <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
    <h2>I believe that the sentiment will be negative because there has been a lot of questions that the human rights issues, as well as the number of underpaid workers that have been working in the world cup that have died because of the poor working conditions.</h2>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <h3>One Determining the Problem:</h3>
    <p> With the process of determining the problem in this project I have been very intrigued by the world cup and the news behind the world cup. <br>There have been a lot of issues that have been going on coming up to the world cup. The negativity behind <br>it has been intense, from the underpaid workers building the stadiums and living spaces <br>to the players not being able to support the LGBTQ community. It seems like the news of negativity <br>was widespread so that is why I believe that the number of tweets positive compared to negative tweets would be more. </p>
    <h3>Two How was the Data Obtained:</h3>
    <p>	The data was obtained from TIRENDAZ ACADEMY on www.kaggle.com, This site has multiple verifiable data sets that people can use to understand more about the world.  </p>
    <h3>Three Data Set and Analysis:</h3>
    <h4>Data Set: </h4>

    <h4>Analysis: </h4>
    <p>As you can see from the data in the data set, more tweets about the world cup were positive 77%<br> compared to the 4% of negative tweets. This proves the hypothesis I made was incorrect. <br>As with most data analysis, there could have been some error in the data creation. One would be the algorithm<br> that the classification of a positive tweet and a negative tweet. Two would be the<br> time that the tweets were made. There could have been more negative sentiment tweets before<br> the world cup began but the data has only tweets from when the world cup started. </p>
